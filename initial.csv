"04.05.2017 15:19:42, Meera Gopi Chandran: Science group I(Monicot/Dicot) finding :"
1. Topic which students feels boring and difficult to learn by lecture method has turned into interesting and activity based learning where the learners explore and developed keen observation.
2. Students are more active and motivated by the use of ICT
3. It is a child centred learning.
"04.05.2017 15:19:42, Meera Gopi Chandran: Geometric shape group: 1.ICT project will improve the learning capabilities of students,  bring motivation and enthusiasm in their studies and spend more times in their learning.                      2. A) students learn figure and shape drawing through this project using computers.     A)  learning process become more meaningful. C) the student will pay more attention because of system change."

"11.05.2017 22:39:01, Arunachal Kumar: Why this certificate course?"

Workshops become a fragmented exercise. Learnings are forgotten. Course allows continuous sharing.

Course is an opportunity to learn in depth about most recent approaches in teaching. A series of readings and tasks can be given here.

"Course encourages teachers to become curious students again, and put on an 'investigator' hat."

Course connects a teacher with fellow teachers in a learning setting and breaks their isolation.

Certification acknowledges the efforts you are already putting in.

Jhum cultivation as an example of 'learning from errors'.

Controlling life of a mollusc by pricking it's heart at will: as an example of 'learning using all senses' and the 'feeling of control'

And the difference between writing a correct answer and ACTUALLY understanding it.

Hats off!

"18.05.2017 12:16:39, Arunachal Kumar: You planned a lesson activity in your subject topic, where students are using ICT applications to create a digital artefact."

"As discussed, this is a gradable activity with 20% weightage in this ICT course (maximum for any activity in this course)."

"Please do implement this in your classroom within the next 2 weeks (latest June 5). We will then upload on the edX platform: a.) Lesson Plan b.) A project created by your student. We will also fill up a small quiz on how the lesson went. I will be sharing links with you for the above two tasks by Monday, 21 May"
"18.05.2017 12:17:18, Arunachal Kumar: Teachers who have lesson plans and artefact photos can share these with other group members."

You are free to revise and improve the plan in any way. You can even make a new plan. Do make this YOUR OWN lesson.
"18.05.2017 12:18:29, Arunachal Kumar: The quiz will test if your activity allowed students to build Pedagogy Pillars of collaboration, learning from errors and authentic learning, in addition to 4Cs and whether ICT tool was 'meaningfully' used."

Feel free to clarify again what each of these mean for a topic in your subject.
"18.05.2017 12:19:12, Arunachal Kumar: Teachers who may have missed the workshop can still complete this ICT course. For this, please check workshop resources on edX course page (Units 2 & 3). Please do also implement an ICT based subject lesson in your class and upload as described above."

Please ask here for any help.

"26.05.2017 17:18:34, Anusha Ramanathan: The stories are wonderful what beautiful handwriting. 😃"

To flesh it out and reformat such stories using technology also brings in the dimension of presentation of ideas and the effect the medium has.

A lovely way to teach them this almost subconsciously.
"26.05.2017 17:22:34, Meera Gopi Chandran: Fela, Rindika Can our team help by installing mindmap in the school server?"

"28.05.2017 21:14:39, Anusha Ramanathan: I think Communication is key and as long as we are able to communicate, minor mistakes that occur as a result of our haste to talk or our discomfort with expressing some thoughts in a language that is not our first language."

"29.05.2017 10:23:51, Meera Gopi Chandran: This may be the right time then for you to take up the unit 4 of the ICT course. You can view the course content using your smartphone also. https://clix.opencraft.hosting/courses/course-v1:TISSx+RTICTENC01+2017_MZ_001/courseware/73d3ae9163c0490f80702addad129e6a/66470cea984945f6a14cd9cab0f3512c/"

"From lct course , help me  all things from any body"
"01.06.2017 17:52:55, Meera Gopi Chandran: Yes, please ask. What is the question?"
"05.06.2017 11:56:07, kulandaisamy: ""If students know how to use Facebook, whatsapp and play games in the Internet, it means they know how to use technology for learning"""
Yes I agree with the the above statement.
"These  days, most of the students have fb account and they are familiar with the use of android phone and they play games in the Internet, so I fully agree that they know how to use the technology."
"05.06.2017 11:58:39, Meera Gopi Chandran: Interesting observation. What do our other colleagues think? Do you agree with the statement?"
"05.06.2017 12:00:57, kulandaisamy: Yes I agree with the statement. Let others Come out with their own opinion."
"05.06.2017 17:27:37, Ruatfela: I agree with the statement. Another challenge is that how a teacher arouse the interest of the learner to the course content. Students use fb because they find it interesting. In order to make them use technology effectively for their learning the role of the teacher is very important. My thought😊"
"05.06.2017 19:22:26, kulandaisamy: True. Use of Fb is interesting so also if we can make the use of technology for learning, definitely it will be interesting. 👍👍"
"05.06.2017 21:48:37, Lalrinsanga Ralte Ralte: If we make fb for teachi ng learning  process , we will draw"

"21.06.2017 11:37:10, Nutan Bharti: How was the class you took Sir? Were the students collaborating?"
"21.06.2017 11:56:49, kulandaisamy: They are interested. Today  RD  took class."
"21.06.2017 12:16:41, Anusha Ramanathan: Sir, we look forward to your inputs and observations."
"21.06.2017 16:16:16, kulandaisamy: In my personal opinion, it is a good programme but we need  technical support every time while using the  computers. The students are weak in English and they do not know how to type like small letters and capital letters and construction of sentences etc. So we have to guide them all the time."
"21.06.2017 17:04:26, Anusha Ramanathan: That is very insightful."

"Students weak in English, in this component of Digital Literacy could also type in Mizo. Though, of course, as an English teacher, I love the fact that they are getting more opportunities to use English. 😃"

We discussed how to make this programme more students oriented and  some suggested that the teacher should be first motivated and Dr. DIKI Will make plans to arrange training to all the teachers in the selected school's."

"25.06.2017 05:48:49, Nutan Bharti: Thanks for sharing this info."
Motivation and much more was there during our F2F.
"In your view , What do you consider the biggest motivator to teach the students??"
"25.06.2017 08:51:30, Hmingthanzuali Ralte: I think intrinsic motivator as it is long lasting and self sustaining, which includes fascination with the subject, a sense of its relevance to life and the world, a sense of accomplishment in mastering it and a sense of calling to it."
"25.06.2017 11:51:14, Nutan Bharti: wonderful 👏👏👏!"
"For teachers, would relevance to life and world include interactions with students also?"
"25.06.2017 12:37:35, Hmingthanzuali Ralte: Of course, since intrinsic method often focus on the subject rather than rewards or punishments, it can be slow to affect behaviour and can require special and lengthy preparation, a variety of approaches may be needed to motivate different students. A teacher should know what interests students in order to connect these interests with the subject matter that requires to know the students. It will be helpful and good for the instructor to be interested in the subject to begin with. Thus, interaction with students is included.."
"25.06.2017 17:58:37, Nutan Bharti: 😊 well said 👍"
"25.06.2017 19:38:23, kulandaisamy: Thank you. I am in Aizawl South and not familiar with that area. First time I have visited that area in my 30 years of stay in Aizawl. In the daytime going from Aizawl South to Aizawl North is like going from North pole to South pole due to traffic jam.."
"25.06.2017 19:39:36, Ruatfela: Hahaha...the area is in the locality border anyway"
"25.06.2017 19:42:10, kulandaisamy: OK"
"25.06.2017 21:20:58, Nutan Bharti: 😊 looks like something new has happenned in thirty years!"
